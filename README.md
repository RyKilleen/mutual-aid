# AWider.NET: Mutual Aid

OSS Mutual aid for .NET and beyond.

## What is Mutual Aid?

[This article](https://ssw.uga.edu/news/article/what-is-mutual-aid-by-joel-izlar/) nicely defines mutual aid:

> Mutual aid is when everyday people get together to meet each other's needs, with the shared understanding that the systems we live in are not meeting our needs and that we can meet them together, right now, without having to pressure power structures to do the right thing.

## What's the Vision? How Will This Work?

* Need assistance with your OSS Project? Check out the [Service Catalog](ServiceCatalog.md) to see what services exist.
* Do you have a repeatable service that == could generally benefit OSS projects? Create an issue here and add it, and we'll see if we can figure out how to make it happen.
* Each service will have a repository here starting with `service-`, e.g. `service-spellchecking`. Services will be "released" whenever guidance / tooling is updated.
* OSS projects can request any of the services that are in the service catalog
* Volunteers raise their hands to help. If they need guidance / mentorship, we'll find a way to provide that.
* At least one other person in the org will review the volunteer implementations, just to make sure we're all learning and keeping quality high.
